```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/db?sslmode=require"

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="<generate-a-long-random-string>"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your-github-oauth-client-id>"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-github-oauth-client-secret>"

# GitHub Organization & Team
ALLOWED_GH_ORG="<your-org-name>"
ALLOWED_GH_TEAM_SLUG="<your-team-slug>"  # Leave empty "" to allow all org members

# Upstash QStash
QSTASH_TOKEN="<your-qstash-token>"
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="<your-current-signing-key>"
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="<your-next-signing-key>"

CRON_SECRET="<generate-a-long-random-string>"
```

**Notes**:
- To find your team slug, go to your GitHub org ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí click on your team. The URL will be `github.com/orgs/YOUR_ORG/teams/YOUR_TEAM_SLUG`.
- Leave `ALLOWED_GH_TEAM_SLUG=""` (empty string) to allow all organization members to access the app.
- For `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, use a verified domain email or `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
- `ACTIVITY_SUMMARY_RECIPIENTS` should be a comma-separated list of email addresses to receive daily summaries
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` is the Power Automate webhook URL for posting to Teams (optional)
- `TEAMS_MENTION_USERS` should be comma-separated UPNs (user@domain.com) to mention in Teams posts (optional)
- `CRON_SECRET` is used to authenticate Vercel Cron requests - generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`

### 8. Set up Vercel Cron Jobs (Optional)

If you want to enable automated daily GitHub activity summaries:

1. Create `vercel.json` in the project root:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-summary",
      "schedule": "0 23 * * 1-5"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/weekly-summary",
      "schedule": "0 23 * * 0"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Cron expressions:
   - Daily: `0 23 * * 1-5` runs Monday-Friday at 11 PM UTC (= Tuesday-Saturday 8 AM JST)
   - Weekly: `0 23 * * 0` runs Sunday at 11 PM UTC (= Monday 8 AM JST)

3. Deploy to Vercel - cron jobs are automatically configured

**Note**: Vercel Cron Jobs are available on all plans including Hobby (free). They run with a 10-second execution limit on Hobby plans.

### 9. Run database migrations

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

### 10. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üìñ Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Sign in with GitHub**

   - Click "Sign in with GitHub" on the landing page
   - Authorize the app with `read:org` and `repo` scopes
   - Only members of your configured org/team will be allowed access

2. **Scan Repositories**

   - Click "Scan All Repositories" on the inventory page
   - The app will enqueue all repositories for background scanning via QStash
   - Refresh the page after a few minutes to see scan results

3. **Browse Inventory**

   - View the table of all scanned repositories
   - Click on a repository name to see detailed detection results
   - View "Evidence" to see which files were used for detection

4. **View Members**

   - Click "View Members" to see organization members
   - Click "Sync Members" to fetch latest member data from GitHub
   - View member roles (Admin/Member), avatars, and activity

5. **View Insights**
   - Click "View Insights" to see charts and graphs
   - Analyze technology distribution across your organization

6. **View Activity Summaries**
   - Click "Activity" to see daily and weekly GitHub activity summaries
   - Automatically generated every weekday at 8 AM JST
   - Delivered via email and Microsoft Teams (if configured)
   - View past summaries with detailed breakdowns by repository and member

### Rescanning

- **Single Repository**: Navigate to repo detail page and click "Rescan"
- **All Repositories**: On the inventory page, click "Scan All Repositories"

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Required GitHub Scopes

- `read:org` - To verify organization and team membership
- `repo` - To read repository files for technology detection

### Access Control

- Only users who are active members of both:
  1. The configured GitHub organization (`ALLOWED_GH_ORG`)
  2. The configured team within that org (`ALLOWED_GH_TEAM_SLUG`)
- Membership is verified on each sign-in
- Session TTL can be configured via `SESSION_TTL_MINUTES`

### Recommendations

- **Production**: Consider implementing a GitHub App for better security
- **Tokens**: Access tokens are session-based
- **Rate Limits**: App respects GitHub API rate limits (5000 req/hour)

## üöÄ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Drizzle migrations
pnpm db:push      # Push schema changes to database
pnpm db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio
```

### Development vs Production Behavior

**Development Mode** (`pnpm dev`, `NODE_ENV=development`):
- Repository scans run **directly** (no QStash)
- **Batch parallel processing**: 10 repositories at a time
- Faster than sequential, safer than full parallel
- No need for ngrok or tunnel services
- Saves QStash free tier quota (500 messages/day)

**Production Mode** (Vercel, `NODE_ENV=production`):
- Repository scans use **Upstash QStash** for background processing
- Each repository is queued individually
- No Vercel execution time limit issues
- Automatic retries and dead letter queue

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add all environment variables from `.env`
4. Update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and GitHub OAuth callback URL to your production domain
5. Deploy
6. Run `pnpm db:push` to sync database schema

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to set these in your hosting platform:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (use a strong random string)
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (your production URL)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your production URL)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ALLOWED_GH_ORG`
- `ALLOWED_GH_TEAM_SLUG` (leave empty to allow all org members)
- `QSTASH_TOKEN`
- `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`
- `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- `ACTIVITY_SUMMARY_RECIPIENTS` (optional, for email summaries)
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional, for Teams notifications)
- `TEAMS_MENTION_USERS` (optional, for Teams mentions)
- `CRON_SECRET`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Not authorized: must be a member of the organization"

- Verify that your GitHub user is a member of the configured org and team
- Check that `ALLOWED_GH_ORG` and `ALLOWED_GH_TEAM_SLUG` are correct
- Ensure the team is not set to "Secret" visibility (must be "Visible")

### GitHub API Rate Limit

- Authenticated requests have a limit of 5000/hour
- The app includes retry logic with exponential backoff
- Development mode uses batch parallel processing (10 repos at a time) to avoid hitting rate limits
- Production mode uses QStash for distributed processing

### QStash Background Jobs Not Processing

- Verify that `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` are correctly set
- Ensure your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is publicly accessible (QStash needs to call your `/api/queue/scan-repo` endpoint)
- Check QStash dashboard for failed jobs and error messages
- **Note**: In development mode (`pnpm dev`), QStash is **not used** - scans run directly to save quota

### Vercel Cron Jobs Not Running

- Verify that `vercel.json` exists in the project root with correct cron configuration
- Ensure `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is set in Vercel project settings
- Check Vercel Logs ‚Üí Cron for execution history and errors
- Cron jobs only run in production deployments, not in development or preview
- Hobby plan cron jobs have a 10-second execution limit
